![Stack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tech-LangGraph%20%7C%20DSPy%20%7C%20Gemini-orange)

An autonomous, multi-agent system designed to automate the grading of complex academic essay questions with human-level reasoning and pedagogical feedback. Developed as a Capstone Project (TCC) in Computer Engineering.

**✨ NEW: Professor Assistant Module with Analytics Dashboard!**

## 📊 Results & Impact

**Currently in pilot deployment at Instituto Federal Fluminense (IFF)** with real coursework and students.

- **5x throughput improvement** — Grading 30 submissions reduced from 10+ minutes to ~2 minutes
- **90% reduction in vector DB queries** via intelligent RAG caching
- **Dual-examiner consensus** — 2 independent Examiner agents + 1 Arbiter reduces bias
- **Full explainability** — Every grade includes written justification traceable to rubric criteria
- **10+ analytics visualizations** — Student evolution tracking, plagiarism detection, learning gap identification

## ⚡ Performance & Recent Improvements

**Latest Update (2026-02-10):**

### 🚀 Speed: 5x Faster Grading
- **Before:** 10 students × 3 questions = ~10 minutes
- **After:** 10 students × 3 questions = ~2-3 minutes
- **How:** Increased parallelism (API_CONCURRENCY 2 → 10)

### 🎯 Quality: Production-Grade Reliability
- ✅ **Grade normalization:** Auto-detects and fixes 0-1 vs 0-10 scale issues
- ✅ **Robust error handling:** Graceful fallbacks when LLM returns invalid JSON
- ✅ **Performance logging:** Detailed timing for debugging bottlenecks
- ✅ **RAG caching:** 90% reduction in vector DB queries

### 📚 Documentation
- [`PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md) - Benchmarks, configuration, troubleshooting
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) - Detailed changelog with migration guide

### Configuration
For Gemini free-tier (recommended to avoid rate limits):
```bash
export API_CONCURRENCY=5
export API_THROTTLE_SLEEP=0.5
```

For OpenAI (paid tier):
```bash
export API_CONCURRENCY=10  # or higher for more speed
```

See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for full configuration guide.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

This system leverages a **Multi-Agent Workflow** orchestrated by **LangGraph** and optimized with **DSPy** for robust prompt engineering.

### The Agents
1.  **🔍 Examiner Agent (C1 & C2):** Two independent instances that grade student submissions against a detailed rubric using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for context.
2.  **⚖️ Arbiter Agent:** Activated only when C1 and C2 diverge significantly (e.g., score difference > 1.5). It reviews arguments from both and decides the final grade.
3.  **🧬 Analytics Engine:** Runs in parallel to detect semantic plagiarism and analyze student evolution trends across submissions.

> **Note:** DSPy agents (`DSPyExaminerAgent`, `DSPyArbiterAgent`) are the active implementation. LangChain agents exist as legacy fallback in `src/agents/legacy/`.

### Workflow Diagram
